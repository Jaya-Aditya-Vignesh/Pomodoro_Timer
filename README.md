What is the Pomodoro Technique?  
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a simple yet powerful approach to work that involves breaking tasks into focused intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and help you maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.

How It Works  
Using the Pomodoro Technique is easy! Here's a basic overview of how it works:  
  Choose a Task: Select a task from your to-do list that you'd like to work on.   
  Set the Timer: Set a timer for 25 minutes, also known as a "Pomodoro" interval.  
  Work on the Task: Focus solely on the chosen task until the timer rings.  
  Take a Break: After each Pomodoro interval, take a short or long break, typically short break is 15 minutes and Long break is 30 mins.  
  Repeat: Repeat the process, taking a longer break (15-30 minutes) after completing four Pomodoro intervals.
